## Source extraction procedure

This Vivado project was generated by copying the sources used by the Vivado project generated by PIQuinteros\Fpga\vivado_projects\ciaa_sistadq_x16.tcl.

Once the original project was generated, VHDL source files were identified using `get_files *.vhd` and manually copied to the `rtl` directory of this new project.

The following adaptations were done:

- Project creation script is now manually written, containing only the minimal info to identify the sources and core project properties.
- IPs and BDs were extracted from the original project as individual Tcl scripts, using `write_ip_tcl` and `write_bd_tcl`.
- `ch_oscillator_bd` was renamed to `beam_osc_bd`, for compatiblity with the existing code.
- `band_processing_bd` and `beam_handler_bd` contain manual modifications to read the COE files.
